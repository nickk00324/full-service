The works that result range from large-scale paintings, textile and architectural installations, weavings, fabric works, cyanotype and dyed pieces, ceramics, and mixed-media collages.

This interest often manifests in the employment of materials and forms that function as semiotic signifiers that refer to historical-cultural contexts or possible masquerading identities. Yuen seeks to explore the aesthetics of mechanical manufacturing, the notions of the handmade, the artist’s hand and the apparent absence of the latter in relationship to chosen materials and how this may lead to questions of an object’s place in context.
