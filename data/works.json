    "description": "This project entailed building an 18 x 24 ft. loft in the existing studio space of Gala Porras Kim.  On the left side of the building, we installed a concrete staircase that was made with a 2-week mold making process.  Upstairs we installed, stained, and sealed the wood floors, put in 2 new electrical outlets and two overhead lights, and also fitted the front of the loft with a combination steel and glass railing.  Downstairs, we drywalled the ceiling and anchor while and installed track lighting for photographing artworks.",

    "description": "We demolished the existing original shed which had suffered significant damage and deterioration from many years of disuse.  Maintaining the existing concrete foundation slab, we rebuilt a 12 x 16 ft. studio space equipped with double barn doors on the front, a new side window, interior insulation and drywall, overhead lighting, 4 electrical outlets, and new roofing.  This project also included the installation of an outdoor slop sink and an outdoor, fabric shade screen.",
