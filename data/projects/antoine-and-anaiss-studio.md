title: Antoine and Anais's Studio
description: We demolished the existing original shed which had suffered
  significant damage and deterioration from many years of disuse.  Maintaining
  the existing concrete foundation slab, we rebuilt a 12 x 16 ft. studio space
  equipped with double barn doors on the front, a new side window, interior
  insulation and drywall, overhead lighting, 4 electrical outlets, and new
  roofing.  This project also included the installation of an outdoor slop sink
  and an outdoor, fabric shade screen.
