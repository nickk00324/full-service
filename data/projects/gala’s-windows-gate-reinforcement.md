title: Gala’s Windows & Gate Reinforcement
description: After an onsite visit, we welded custom security bar covers for two
  exterior windows of the studio building.  Additionally, the gate was warping
  in a way that made it difficult to open and close, so we reinforced the gate
  to solve the disruption.
