title: Tentative Concrete
description: Cecilie Bendixen and Sophus Ejler Jepsen's project *TENTATIVE
  CONCRETE* is a durational performance of translation and construction,
  responding to the restrictions of the COIVD-19 travel ban.  Two concrete
  installations were constructed and installed over the course of seven weeks,
  one in the backyard of the Schindler House and the other in the artists' own
  garden.  Each week, Bendixen and Jepsen shared haptic and tactile instructions
  with us, Casey Baden and Kenneth Yuen of Full Service Creative, for us to
  interpret and build the concrete and burlap structures, trademark of
  Bendixen's practice.  Visitors were invited to view the fabrication in real
  time, every Saturday between May 1 - June 12, 2021.
