title: Shirley Tse - Amber Room
description: We were hired by artist Shirley Tse to modify this existing
  sculpture named *Amber Room*. The modification process involved adding
  additional hardware to the bottom of the sculpture that was used to
  permanently install it publicly/outdoors. The task involved metal fabrication
  and welding processes. However, the added parts had to be color-matched and
  faded into the sculpture's existing paint/finish for a seamless look, ensuring
  the modification seemed original to the sculpture. *Amber Room* is displayed
  publicly at Bergamot Station Arts Center in Los Angeles, California.
