title: Sarah's Benches
description: For Sarah Ann Weber’s exhibition, *Strong Blossoming Thing
  Forever*, on view at Anat Ebgi Gallery June 18 - July 31, 2021, we
  collaborated with the artist to create two one-of-a-kind concrete benches
  embellished with a floral motif impression created from plant cuttings trimmed
  from her own garden.  The impressions in the benches mirror the imagery in her
  paintings and works on paper which aim to uncover the dualities of nature --
  both as a source of beauty and innocence, equally entwined with aggression and
  indifference.
