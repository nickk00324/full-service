title: Gala's Loft
description: This project entailed building an 18 x 24 ft. loft in the existing
  studio space of Gala Porras Kim.  On the left side of the building, we
  installed a concrete staircase that was made with a 2-week mold making
  process.  Upstairs we installed, stained, and sealed the wood floors, put in 2
  new electrical outlets and two overhead lights, and also fitted the front of
  the loft with a combination steel and glass railing.  Downstairs, we drywalled
  the ceiling and anchor wall and installed track lighting for photographing
  artworks.
