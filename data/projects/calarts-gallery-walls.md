title: CalArts Gallery Walls
description: In order to offer the 2021 graduating class of CalArts some option
  for exhibition installation in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we were
  contracted to build 176 feet of temporary gallery walls across 4 locations in
  commercial buildings in downtown Newhall to provide widow-viewable exhibition
  space for the graduates.
