To achieve this I mix unconscious elements with tropes from painting history, blend them with contemporary imagery and juxtapose personal experiences onto the aggregate. My style is classical paint handling, combined with a surrealist thought process which also includes Japanese woodblock print influence. As a painter I have learned to dissect what I see, I take mental notes of every color and contour I come across, watching the trees, or absorb a gaze in face to face conversation. It is important as an artist to know and change the socio-economic issues that effect my community, but the politics are not blatant in the form of my work. I base my work in an era that most people believe has not come upon us, I mean for it to be the golden age after tumultuous times. Something regal can come from immense inherited damage. This idea can easily be overlooked, but the visceral experience of my paintings stain the viewers thoughts and bring these ideas to their unconscious mind through traditional methods, without exploiting culture.
