In this show, entitled{\" \"}\n            <em>BOU.</em>, a formidable population of characters, personages,\n            creatures and things band together and play out and apart in a\n            turbulent pool of fantasy and intricately fictive narrative. People\n            abound in Ford’s images, but certainty regarding their status as\n            human, god, android, alien or cartoon is always in question, always\n            in flux. These are taxonomically variable beings. They emerge in the\n            theater of Ford’s universe, a universe that blurs the lines between\n            what we believe to be real and unreal, between dream and stark\n            wakeful consciousness.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A statement from the artist: “I want the viewer to feel the passion\n            and deep thought in my work. To achieve this I mix unconscious\n            elements with tropes from painting history, blend them with\n            contemporary imagery and juxtapose personal experiences onto the\n            aggregate. My style is classical paint handling, combined with a\n            surrealist thought process which also includes Japanese woodblock\n            print influence. As a painter I have learned to dissect what I see,\n            I take mental notes of every color and contour I come across,\n            watching the trees, or absorb a gaze in face to face conversation.\n            It is important as an artist to know and change the socio-economic\n            issues that effect my community, but the politics are not blatant in\n            the form of my work. I base my work in an era that most people\n            believe has not come upon us, I mean for it to be the golden age\n            after tumultuous times. Something regal can come from immense\n            inherited damage. This idea can easily be overlooked, but the\n            visceral experience of my paintings stain the viewers thoughts and\n            bring these ideas to their unconscious mind through traditional\n            methods, without exploiting culture. I would like my work to be a\n            part of the hope people seek in humanity.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Originally from the Inland Empire and currently residing in Los\n            Angeles, Elijah Ford received a BA from California State University\n            San Bernardino in 2011 and an MFA in Painting from California\n            Institute of the Arts in 2014.

In{\" \"}\n            <em>Displace</em>\n            the artist begins with the forced deportation of the inhabitants of\n            the Chagos Archipelago from 1967 to 1973 by the British government\n            in order to accommodate the construction of a U.S. military base and\n            traces his own ancestors history of displacement and the effects it\n            has on people and communities.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The Chagos Archipelago was considered under the control of the\n            country of Mauritius, a British colony, until 1965 when Mauritius\n            sought its independence and the Chagos Archipelago was split off as\n            a condition of its independence. Thus beginning in 1967, around\n            1,500 inhabitants were removed and forced to re-settle in the\n            neighboring Seychelles and Mauritius, where many died because of the\n            horrible living conditions they were forced into along with the\n            severe trauma of being removed from their homes and the only lives\n            they ever knew. Ford considers this event in relation to the history\n            of colonization and the altered futures it has created. His\n            paintings depict imagery and symbols that are constantly slipping\n            and changing, creating an imbalance in an always de-centered center.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Errantry and exile creating a rhizomatic root that proliferates,\n            never crushing difference, but one that encounters difference and\n            accepts it in all its opacity, the chaos of connections that builds\n            a network where one can relate one’s experience without reducing,\n            never reduction. The work proposes an environment where people,\n            cultures, and communities can recognize each other in the face of\n            the Other, where no generalization occurs, where every plight is\n            understood in all its complexities, in solidarity with the\n            sufferings and resiliency of a people and a people yet to come.\n          </p>\n        </Entry>\n        <Entry>\n          <h3>\n            <em>Friends on Freeways</em> @ Klinger Studios\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            In the work I attempt to capture the euphoric feeling when spending\n            time with beloved ones and relate that to a sublime, seemingly\n            endless road. The work is meant to raise questions like will mortal\n            memories made in this reality last for eternity? The freeway as the\n            hyperbolic road is the metonym chosen to encompass and reflect the\n            portrait of just a few of many good friends.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A small Collection of other paintings, prints, and handmade\n            colouring books will also be available for purchase.
